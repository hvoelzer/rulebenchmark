## Inspect the results of run 1
- go to https://github.com/hvoelzer/rulebenchmark/blob/main/rulebenchmark/viz-svg.ipynb
- download the raw results at https://github.com/hvoelzer/rulebenchmark/blob/main/rulebenchmark/results_1.csv


## Inspect results of other runs, Change charts
- use and modify viz.ipynb
- you can use any of the results_k.csv files in viz.ipynb


## Re-run the benchmarking on your hardware
- install this project
- download missing data sets into data directory (links to sources in data_configs.py)
- configure main parameters in run_benchmarking.py
- execute run_benchmarking.py


## Add a data set, or run only selected data sets


## Add a rule induction pipeline, or select pipelines to run
